# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

This project/website was designed as a go-to for coding bootcamp students to reference on topics that I found to be useful in remembering. I have a poor memory at times and as such I require a little more time for rote memorization to really kick in, especially when trying to remember Git commands. My hope is that the few bullet points I've listen here will help in sparking memory of rote commands as well as a few reminders with specifics formating rules. 

## Installation

N/A

## Usage
First, each section contains notes regarding the following topics: HTML, CSS, GIT, and JavaScript. These items were a couple I found to be helpful reminders with regads to onging study. Second, the console in DevTools will show an example of runnign JavaScript. It will list the topics I learned from the pre-work, as well as give a suggestion as to what someone could study first as a small jump-off point. To access the DevTools on Chrome, right-click anywhere on the page(or use Control+Shift+I) and select Inspect. You can see the HTML, CSS, and under console, the JavaScript used in the making of this site.
