        <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
        <li>The Title element defines a webpages title. This Element is required for publishing and helps SEO.</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside of an element.</li>
          <li>Style attibute can be use to change a single h1 heading. Less flexible as the changes are individual to the line.</li>
          <li>Style Element is internal and the rules for the PAGE itself in the Head element.</li>
          <li>Commonly though, a link element is used for an external CSS style sheet and stored as a separate file, where changes are easier to make.</li>
          <li>Padding, while transparent, is located inside the element, whereas the margin is the transparent buffer outside an element.</li>
          <li>It is important to know that every HTML element is essentially a box. Each box consists of margins outside the element, and the element's borders, padding, and content. This is sometimes referred to as the CSS box model.</li>
          <li>The period preceding a "class" designates this as a class selector. Any HTML element assigned to the class name will gain these property assignments from the CSS</li>

          <li>console.log is used to output the variable results to the console in-browser.</li>
          <li>JS is read by a computer from the top down, meaning that all programming logic must have a thoughline. You can't run console.log first for example, as it has nothing to display with defined output(s). This is called a control flow. </li>
          <li>"var" can be used to set up an array and can be utilized in a 'for' loop. arrays are configured in index 0 (items are listed as 0,1,2,3,...)</li>
          <li>For is a looping command that will run until an end parameter is met, this in conjuntion with an array can save coding time.</li>
