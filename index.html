        <ul>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how mcuh space we want around the content inside of an element.</li>
          <li>Style attibute can be use to change a single h1 heading. Less flexible as the changes are individual to the line.</li>
          <li>Style Element is internal and the rules for the PAGE itself in the Head element.</li>
          <li>Commonly though, a link element is used for an external CSS style sheet and stored as a separate file, where changes are easier to make.</li>
          <li>Padding, while transparent, is located inside the element, whereas the margin is the transparent buffer outside an element.</li>
          <li>It is important to know that every HTML element is essentially a box. Each box consists of margins outside the element, and the element's borders, padding, and content. This is sometimes referred to as the CSS box model.</li>
          <li>The period preceding a "class" designates this as a class selector. Any HTML element assigned to the class name will gain these property assignments from the CSS</li>
